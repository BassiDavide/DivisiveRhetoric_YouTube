Start by running the scraping script. 
It just needs to have the YouTube API inserted, which can be found in the YouTube API console, and .csv files paths where to save the results. 
At the moment, the script is set to look for immigration videos, to change to climate, it's just necessary commenting out the immigration query, and viceversa with the climate, like this: 

#queries = [
#    'immigration',
#    'migration crisis',
#    'asylum refugees seeker',
#    'border control',
#    'migrant welcoming',
#    'solidarity migrants',
#]

# Climate
queries = [
    'climate change'
    'global warming'
    'climate activism'
    'climate policies'
    'climate change hoax'
    'eco anxiety'
]

The comment scraper, just need as input the path of the file containing the list of videos from which crawl the comments.
